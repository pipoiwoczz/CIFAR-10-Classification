# üìö CIFAR-10 Image Classification (MLP Benchmark Across Libraries)

This project presents an implementation and comparison of Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models on the CIFAR-10 dataset using four machine learning libraries:

- [x] Scikit-learn
- [x] TensorFlow / Keras
- [x] PyTorch
- [x] JAX (with Flax)

The objective is to evaluate each framework based on performance (training time, GPU memory usage), ease of implementation, and training results ‚Äî all using a **consistent architecture** and methodology.

---

## üéØ Project Objective

Explore and benchmark popular ML libraries by implementing the same MLP model in:

- **Scikit-learn** for simplicity
- **TensorFlow** for high-level abstraction
- **PyTorch** for low-level flexibility
- **JAX** for performance and functional programming style

This allows for a fair comparison between ease of use, training efficiency, and model behavior.

## üß† Model Architecture

All implementations use the **same MLP structure**:

- **Input Layer**: 3072 neurons (flattened 32√ó32√ó3 images)
- **Hidden Layers**:
  - Layer 1: 1024 units (ReLU)
  - Layer 2: 512 units (ReLU)
  - Layer 3: 256 units (ReLU)
- **Output Layer**: 10 neurons (Softmax)
- **Dropout**: 0.3 applied between hidden layers
- **Loss Function**: Cross-Entropy
- **Optimizer**: Adam, learning rate = 0.0001
- **Early Stopping**: patience = 5 (monitors validation accuracy)
